# What is a Slack App Manifest?

A **Slack app manifest** is a JSON or YAML file that defines the configuration, capabilities, and permissions of your Slack app. It acts as a blueprint that tells Slack what your app can do, how it appears, and what permissions it needs. The manifest is used when creating or updating an app in the Slack API dashboard, and it enables you to:

- Specify your app's name, description, and icon
- Define bot users and their behavior
- Set up slash commands
- List OAuth scopes (permissions)
- Configure event subscriptions and interactivity
- Manage other app features and settings

Using a manifest makes it easy to share, version, and reproduce your app configuration across environments or teams.
