Inquiry-Based Labs shift the focus from simply following procedures to designing and carrying out investigations. Students formulate hypotheses, plan experiments, collect and analyze data, and draw conclusions. This mirrors authentic scientific practice and helps students develop critical thinking skills.

**Implementation tips**
- Provide guiding questions but avoid step-by-step instructions.
- Encourage reflection on data quality and alternative explanations.
- Allow time for students to present and critique results.

Studies indicate that inquiry-driven labs can increase motivation and promote a deeper understanding of scientific concepts.
