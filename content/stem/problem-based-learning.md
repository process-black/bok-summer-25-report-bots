Problem-Based Learning (PBL) places students in the role of investigators faced with complex problems. They must determine what they need to learn, research and apply new information, and present solutions. In STEM fields, PBL connects theory to practice and builds collaboration skills.

**Key elements**
- Present an ill-structured problem with no single correct answer.
- Allow students to identify knowledge gaps and research needed concepts.
- Facilitate team discussions and solution proposals.

Extensive research highlights PBL's ability to foster deeper understanding and transferable problem-solving skills.
