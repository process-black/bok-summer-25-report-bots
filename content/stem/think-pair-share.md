Think-Pair-Share is a structured discussion technique where learners first think about a question or problem individually, then pair with a partner to discuss their ideas, and finally share with the whole class. This approach encourages every student to participate and gives them time to articulate their reasoning before speaking in front of a larger group. Research shows that this method increases student engagement and helps identify misconceptions early.

**Steps**
1. Pose a challenging question.
2. Give students a minute to think silently.
3. Have students discuss their thoughts with a partner.
4. Invite pairs to share their conclusions with the class.

This activity can be used at any point during a lesson to prompt reflection or check understanding.
