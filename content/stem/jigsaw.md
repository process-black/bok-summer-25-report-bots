In a jigsaw activity, the class is divided into "home" groups. Each student then joins an "expert" group to learn about a specific subtopic or problem. After mastering the material, students return to their home groups and teach their portion to the others. This interdependence encourages accountability and deepens comprehension.

**Benefits**
- Promotes cooperative learning and communication skills.
- Ensures that all students contribute unique information.
- Works well for breaking down complex topics into manageable pieces.
