This directory contains brief guides for a variety of research-supported active learning techniques commonly used in STEM education. Each Markdown file describes an activity and provides tips for implementation.

Available activities:
- [Think-Pair-Share](./think-pair-share.md)
- [Peer Instruction](./peer-instruction.md)
- [Jigsaw](./jigsaw.md)
- [Problem-Based Learning](./problem-based-learning.md)
- [Inquiry-Based Labs](./inquiry-based-labs.md)

These resources draw on findings summarized in the 2014 meta-analysis by Freeman et al., which demonstrated that active learning strategies improve student performance across STEM disciplines.
