Peer Instruction involves posing a conceptual multiple-choice question, having students vote on an answer, encouraging them to discuss the reasoning with neighbors, and then revoting. Developed by Eric Mazur for physics courses, this method has been shown to improve conceptual understanding and long-term retention.

**Typical workflow**
1. Instructor poses a question (often via clickers or polling software).
2. Students vote individually.
3. Students discuss with peers who chose different answers.
4. Students vote again; instructor addresses the results.

This approach works well in large lectures and can reveal misconceptions in real time.
